# Emberwing

**Star Airborne. The long glide.**

Emberwing is a small, browser-based flight game about dogfighting in open space.  
Inspired by classic Star Wars–style missions, it’s built to be beautiful, fast, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

No installs. No accounts. Just flight.

## Emberwing — White Paper

### What Emberwing Is  
Emberwing is an arcade-style space flight game you can play in a web browser. You fly a single ship, enter short dogfighting missions, and stay airborne as long as you can. The focus is feel, clarity, and joy—not progression systems or complexity.

It’s meant to feel immediate and human: load the page, take off, fly.

### Why It Exists  
Modern games often ask for too much—time, money, attention, commitment. Emberwing is a response to that. It’s built for lightness. A game you can return to without friction.

Emberwing exists to prove that a game can be:
- small but complete  
- accessible but beautiful  
- action-driven without being loud  

### Core Principles  
- **Accessible**  
  Runs in a browser. No install. Anyone with an internet connection can play.

- **Simple**  
  One ship. Clear objectives. Short missions. No clutter.

- **Kinetic**  
  Tight, responsive dogfighting inspired by classic space combat games.

- **Beautiful**  
  Clean visuals, open space, and a sense of calm even in motion.

- **Respectful of Time**  
  Missions are short. No grind. No pressure to keep up.

### What the Game Is Like  
Emberwing is built around:
- arcade flight controls (keyboard, mouse, joystick)
- mission-based dogfights
- protecting convoys, chasing fighters, flying under pressure
- clear briefings, radio chatter, and debriefs

It leans into the feeling of being a pilot on assignment—focused, alone, and moving through space.

### What It Is Not  
Emberwing is not:
- a live-service game  
- a progression treadmill  
- a lore encyclopedia  
- a competitive esport  

There are no unlock trees, no currencies, no accounts, no noise.

### Technology Philosophy  
Emberwing is built for the open web.  
Using modern browser technology allows it to be shared as a simple link. The game should feel closer to a short film or a sketch than a product.

### Long-Term Vision  
Emberwing may grow slowly:
- more missions  
- new environments  
- subtle variations in ships or challenges  

Growth is optional. The core experience must always remain intact: fly, fight, glide, return.

## Closing

Emberwing is a small project by design.  
A quiet game about motion, focus, and staying airborne.

Nothing more than that.
